    <h2 class="title"><i>What is CSS?</i></h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="l1">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet.</li>
        <li class="l1">CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li>
        <li class="l1"><span id="a2">CSS is not necessary </span> 
            <span id="a1"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span>It can contol the
            layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
        <li class="l1"> <u> External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</u></li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="title"> <i>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways: </i></h2>
    <ul class="">
        <li class="l2">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li class="l2">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li class="l2">External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li class="l2">The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. how ever,<span id="a3"> in this tutitorial we
            will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it
            yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,
        on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to
        link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
        
        <p class="p1"> In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific
        element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be
        applied to the elements.</p> 
        
        <p class="p1">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are
        class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
